                    <b>Garage Mold Removal</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mold is often times found in the garage. The reason is that most homeowners spend very little actual time in their garages. If you don't count having to drive your car, it's usually a place to store things that aren't being used on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Why is there Mold in your Garage?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You pull your car in, maybe unload the groceries, and head straight for the house. One the way in you hit the automatic garage door open to close the door and turn off the lights. Your garage suffers from a lack of air circulation and it is kept dark most of the time. Hardly anyone air conditions their garage, so it is usually warmer than the rest of your house 75%-80% of the year. Mold grows best in dark, warm environments. All it needs in your garage is a little water to be happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You say you don't have any water in your garage? There have been no leaks that you know of? You see, that's problem. Maybe there is a leak inside a wall. Maybe there is a roof problem that you don't know about that is allowing water to get into your garage. It's possible that the bottom seal on the garage door doesn't completely keep out of the rain. Or the problem could be high humidity from having the garage closed up most of the time. One way or another there is a problem involving moisture that is allowing the mold to grow.

                    <b>What kind of damage can Mold do in my garage?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mold can negatively affect your garage the same way that it can affect the rest of your house. As mold grows, it devours what it is growing in. It will do permanent damage to drywall and if left in place long enough, will destroy the structural integrity of wooden framing materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mold can also cause health problems for people that are exposed to it and that are sensitive to it. It can cause headaches, respiratory problems, coughing, listlessness and memory confusion, and skin rashes. Mold is often blamed for the development of asthma in adults and especially young children. Individuals most at risk include seniors, very young children, pregnant women, and anyone with any type of immune disorder. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How Should Garage Mold be Removed?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though your garage is not considered "living" space, a mold problem in it should not be taken lightly. The entry door into your home needs to be sealed shut before you make any attempt to remove any mold or even disturb it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mold is like any other living organism in that it will attempt to defend itself when "attacked". Depending on the type of mold it is, it could release mycotoxins (myco means fungus) as a means of defending itself. Some of these mycotoxins are the most toxic substances known. It can take several years for the some mycotoxins to lose their toxicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should never attempt to kill mold with chlorine bleach (anyone that says to use bleach to kill mold on porous surfaces doesn't know what they are talking about) or just cover over it with a paint-like sealer. Mold should always be removed along with any organic material that it is growing on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to safely removing garage mold, or mold anywhere in your home, you should rely on a professional remediation company like <b>Water Mold Fire Restoration</b>.

                    <b>How can I prevent Garage Mold in the future?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best way to prevent garage mold is to make sure that moisture never becomes an issue.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep an eye out for any water leaks in your garage.</li>
                    <li>See that the garage door seal on the bottom of the garage door seals completely so that rain can't enter under it.</li>
                    <li>Make sure gutters and downspouts aren't clogged and water doesn't overflow them.</li>
                    <li>Consider installing an exhaust fan in the garage to eliminate humidity buildup during warmer seasons of the year.</li>
                    <li>Every once in a while leave the light on for 24 hours. The electricity for one or two light bulbs will cost way less than a mold remediation project.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
